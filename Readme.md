# Go REST API Example
===========

This is a simple example of a REST API written in Go. It uses the Gin framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.

To run the API, you will need to have Go installed on your computer. You can then run the following command in the project directory:

```
go run main.go
```

This will start the API and make it available at http://localhost:8080.
